## Question 1: Which option Do you plan to pursue?

```         
I still plan to pursue option 1. I still like the idea of creating three different visualizations that will all work together towards one message or theme.
```

## Question 2: Re-state your questions - has this changed at all since HW 1?

    ' In this study, we examine the relationship between temperature trends and loggerhead turtle nesting activity over the past four decades. '
    

## Question 3: Explain which variables from your dataset(s) you will use to answer your question - and how.

    

## Question 4: Find at least two data visualizations that you could (potentially) borrow / adapt pieces from. Link to them or download and embed them into your .qmd file, and explain which elements you might borrow (e.g. the graphic form, legend design, layout, etc.).

![](turtleviz1.jpeg)
    What I like: I want to re-create the zoomed in map on the regions specified in the paper (eg: south pacific, caribbean, etc.) I also find the colors to be very intuitive.  



![](turtleviz2.jpeg)
    What I like: I like this graphic form and the order of the visualizations. I'd like to do something similar with the background being the ocean. I alsdo like the line chart, but I do feel that this viz is displaying too many things in one picture. 
    
## Question 5: Hand-draw your anticipated visualizations.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-alt: "Alt text here"


# knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image")
```

## Question 6: Mock-up of hand-drawn visualizations

### Read in Turtle Nesting Data

```{r}
# Set the SHAPE_RESTORE_SHX config option
Sys.setenv("SHAPE_RESTORE_SHX" = "YES")

# Read the shapefile
shapefile_path <- "C:/MEDS/EDS240-dataviz/Assignments/newby-eds240-HW4/data/nestingbeaches_GCB.shp"
turtles <- st_read(shapefile_path) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names()
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
# Check CRS
st_crs(turtles)

# Unique Countries
unique(turtles$country)

Excerpt about mann-kendall from paper: 'The Mann–Kendall tests showed a significant increase in nest count trends at multiple sites (Table 1; Figure 1). Sharp increases (Mann–Kendall >0.70) were observed in the Caribbean (Grand Cayman), Southwest Atlantic (Sergipe, Bahia), Southeast Atlantic (Sal, Maio), Mediterranean (West Cyprus, Dalyan, Sicily) and Western Indian (Kwazulu). In comparison, significant positive but less sharp increases (Mann–Kendall <0.70) were found in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (Quintana Roo, Tankah, South Carolina, Northeast Florida, Sanibel, Sarasota), Southwest Atlantic (Espírito Santo), Southeast Atlantic (Santa Luzia, Boa Vista, João Barrosa), Mediterranean (North Cyprus, Çirali), Western Indian (Malongane) and Western Pacific (Yakushima). Only one site significantly decreased the number of nests over time: Masirah Island in Oman (Arabian Sea), with a significant Mann–Kendall slope of −0.78. The remaining regions had no significant pattern and thus were considered stable: East Florida, Panhandle and West Florida, Rio de Janeiro, Zakynthos and Ningaloo.'

## Question 7a: What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R? If you struggled with mocking up any of your three visualizations (from #6, above), describe those challenges here.

## Question 7b: What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven’t covered in class that you’ll be learning how to use for your visualizations?

## Question 7c: What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?

    Should I do it by country or by region?
